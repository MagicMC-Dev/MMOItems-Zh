# Item sets let you create links betweens the different items you create.
# By wearing multiple items from the same set, the player will benefit from
# set bonuses which incites him to use items from the same type.
# This is a very powerful system for RPG items.
#
# You can also use potion effects as set bonuses, e.g
# - "potion-speed: 2" gives permanent Speed II
# - "potion-increase_damage: 3" gives permanent Strength III

#
# You may also add abilities as full set bonuses. The ability ID
# must start with 'ability-' but it is only used as reference.
# You can configure the ability cast mode, type & modifiers as usual.
